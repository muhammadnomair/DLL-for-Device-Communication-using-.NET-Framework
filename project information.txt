--- DLL for Request and Resposne based Device-Communication in .NET Framewortk using C# ---
In this comprehensive and detailed project, I have designed and created a dynamic linked library (.dll) for, first, communicating the device using request packet, and then extracted payload-buffer from resposne packet.
However, the .DLL returns the bytes buffer as response. The response payload buffer should be parsed (decoded) according to the user requirements.
This project solution has two projects: 
1) "DeviceTelemetryDLL" project for creating a "DeviceTelemetryDLL" file, 
2) "DeviceTelemetryDLLConsoleApp" project for testing the created .dll file 

Note:
This .dll file will be saved in the path (\DeviceTelemetryDLL\bin\Debug\net6.0) after compiling the project.

Requirements:
In order to successfully creating the .dll file for device-heartbeat telemetry, the end-user should provide the following input to the "GetTelemetryResposneData" function, which is in the "TestDLL" class of the "DeviceTelemetryDLLConsoleApp" project.
The DLL inputs (in-oder); 
1) Interface index (index of network interface with which the device is connected), index should start from 0
2) Time-interval value (ms) for scheduling the Heartbeat telemetry request
